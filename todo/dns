In Shrew.java, I used
	connection.getInetAddress().getHostName()
(commented out in the current code)
And it waits for 5 seconds and times out (returning the IP address string).

What does it do in these 5 seconds? Do we have the proper resolver code?
Do we need to configure the resolver? If not configured, why does it not
give up immediately instead of waiting 5 seconds? If we configure it
properly, will it work?
