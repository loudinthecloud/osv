To measure netwroking throughput we use netperf-2.6.0,

The netperf client isn't working in OS-v, only netserver,
and only after applying a small patch to the source.


How to compile netperf from source so it'll run on osv:

1. checkout the netperf-2.6.0 source from the following URL:
http://www.netperf.org/netperf/DownloadNetperf.html

2. compile regularly on linux, we're building the binaries that run on the host now.
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

3. apply the osv patch to netperf
$ patch -p1 < osv.patch

4. build again
$ make clean
$ make CFLGAS="-fPIC -shared"

5. copy src/netserver and use it in OS-v.



Starting netserver

[osv]$ run /tools/netserver-osv -D -4 -f

 
Connecting using netperf

[linux]$ ./netperf-linux -H 192.168.122.100
